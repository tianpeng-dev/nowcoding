# NowCoding

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README_zh.md)

Public AI coding activity for your GitHub profile, personal site, and team
dashboards.

NowCoding collects usage from local AI coding tools, normalizes it into daily
token and cost buckets, and publishes a privacy-aware profile with embeddable
SVG cards and badges. Use the hosted Cloud path for zero-server setup, or
self-host the open-source web app when you want to own the full deployment.

## What it shows

- Today, last 7 days, last 30 days, and all-time token totals.
- Estimated cost, calculated on the server from normalized model usage.
- Live status from heartbeat or recent sync activity.
- Streaks and yearly heatmap using the configured owner timezone.
- Top models and tools used over the selected period.
- GitHub-ready SVG cards and badges. The V2 README card includes tokens,
  estimated cost, live status, a 7-day token sparkline, top model, estimated
  AI-assisted time saved, peak activity, streak, and one highlighted milestone.

## Completeness snapshot

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local collection | Complete | CLI discovers supported AI coding tools and parses local usage files. |
| Parser coverage | Complete for v1 | 18 registered sources, 16 full parsers, 2 disabled. |
| Sync pipeline | Complete | Buckets and sessions are deduplicated by source, model, project, hostname, and time. |
| API auth | Complete | Ingest and heartbeat endpoints require bearer token auth. |
| Public profile | Complete | Shows live, today, week, total, cost, streak, heatmap, models, and tools. |
| SVG embeds | Complete | Card plus `today`, `week`, `total`, `model`, `streak`, and `live` badges. |
| Background sync | Complete | Watch mode plus daemon support for macOS launchd and Linux systemd user services. |
| Deployment | Complete | Vercel app with standard Postgres documented in `docs/deploy.md`; Cloud V2 uses Supabase. |
| Privacy controls | Complete | Local and server privacy gates are both required before optional fields are stored. |
| Multi-device storage | Partial UI | Hostname is stored for dedupe; device dashboards are not first-class yet. |
| Realtime GitHub display | External cache | GitHub README images are cached by GitHub and may update minutes later. |

## Architecture

```text
Local AI tool logs
        |
        v
nowcoding CLI parsers
        |
        v
bucket/session aggregation
        |
        v
POST /api/usage/ingest + /api/usage/heartbeat
        |
        v
Postgres
        |
        v
profile page, API routes, SVG card, SVG badges, OG images
```

The app does not send prompt text. It stores normalized usage metadata such as
source, model, token counts, estimated cost, bucket time, optional project name,
and optional hostname depending on privacy settings.

## Supported tools

NowCoding currently registers 18 parser sources.

Full source-specific parsers:

```text
claude-code, codex, gemini-cli, github-copilot-cli, opencode, openclaw,
pi, qwen-code, kimi-code, amp, droid, hermes, kiro, cline, roo-code,
antigravity
```

Disabled by design:

```text
cursor, windsurf
```

Cursor and Windsurf are registered so their status is explicit, but they are not
parsed until their local data formats are safe and stable enough for this
project. See [docs/parsers.md](docs/parsers.md) for the current parser matrix
and fixture requirements.

## NowCoding Cloud

Hosted V2 is the lowest-friction path when you want official profile, card,
badge, streak, and Arena leaderboard links without deploying your own server:

```bash
npm install -g nowcoding
nowcoding login
nowcoding daemon install
```

Official Cloud will live under `https://nowcoding.cc`. Planned public surfaces:

- `https://nowcoding.cc` for product, login, and account entry.
- `https://nowcoding.cc/<username>` for official public profiles.
- `https://nowcoding.cc/<username>/card.svg` for README cards.
- `https://nowcoding.cc/<username>/badge/<type>.svg` for badges.
- `https://nowcoding.cc/arena` for the opt-in public leaderboard.

`nowcoding login` opens GitHub OAuth and asks for Cloud upload consent. The
Cloud prompt also includes Arena consent: "Join NowCoding Arena" is checked by
default, but the prompt shows the public fields before confirmation and you can
uncheck it. Arena powers the hosted leaderboard; Cloud profile/card/badge upload
can be used without joining Arena.

Self-hosted mode does not contact NowCoding Cloud or Arena unless you explicitly
run `nowcoding login` or `nowcoding arena connect`.

## Self-hosted quick start

Deploy the open-source self-host web app:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftianpeng-dev%2Fnowcoding&env=NOWCODING_USERNAME,NOWCODING_API_TOKEN,CRON_SECRET&envDescription=Set%20your%20public%20NowCoding%20username%2C%20paste%20a%20secret%20token%20from%20%60npx%20nowcoding%20gen-token%60%2C%20and%20add%20a%20strong%20random%20cron%20secret.&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftianpeng-dev%2Fnowcoding%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fdocs%2Fenv.md&project-name=nowcoding&repository-name=nowcoding)

Requirements:

- Node.js 20 or newer.
- pnpm 9 or newer.
- A Vercel project.
- A Supabase Postgres database or any standard Postgres database.

Generate an ingest token:

```bash
npx nowcoding gen-token
```

Deploy the web app, then configure these environment variables:

```text
NOWCODING_USERNAME=peng
NOWCODING_API_TOKEN=<token from gen-token>
CRON_SECRET=<strong random secret>
DATABASE_URL=<Supabase pooler or standard Postgres connection string>
```

Push the database schema:

```bash
DATABASE_URL='<Postgres connection string>' pnpm db:push
```

Connect the local CLI to your deployed app:

```bash
npx nowcoding init --endpoint https://your-name.vercel.app
npx nowcoding sync
```

For continuous updates, use watch mode:

```bash
npx nowcoding sync --watch
```

Or install the daemon:

```bash
npm install -g nowcoding
nowcoding daemon install
nowcoding daemon start
```

Daemon install supports macOS launchd and Linux systemd user services. It
requires a stable binary path and refuses transient `npx` or `pnpm dlx` paths.

## Embed in GitHub

Add the SVG card to a GitHub profile README:

```md
<a href="https://nowcoding.vercel.app">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://nowcoding.vercel.app/card.svg?theme=dark" />
    <img src="https://nowcoding.vercel.app/card.svg" alt="NowCoding activity" />
  </picture>
</a>
```

For your own deployment, replace `https://nowcoding.vercel.app` with your
official Cloud profile URL or your self-hosted Vercel URL. Add badges:

```md
![Today](https://your-name.vercel.app/badge/today.svg)
![Week](https://your-name.vercel.app/badge/week.svg)
![Streak](https://your-name.vercel.app/badge/streak.svg)
![Live](https://your-name.vercel.app/badge/live.svg)
```

GitHub caches README images outside of NowCoding. The SVG routes send a short
cache lifetime, but GitHub may still refresh images after several minutes or
longer.

## CLI commands

```bash
nowcoding init [--endpoint <url>] [--token <token>] [--hostname <name>]
nowcoding sync [--dry-run] [--source <name>] [--strict]
nowcoding sync --watch [--watch-interval <ms>]
nowcoding heartbeat
nowcoding status
nowcoding doctor
nowcoding gen-token
nowcoding daemon status
nowcoding daemon install
nowcoding daemon start
nowcoding daemon stop
nowcoding daemon restart
nowcoding daemon uninstall
nowcoding daemon foreground
```

See [apps/cli/README.md](apps/cli/README.md) for CLI-specific setup and daemon
details.

## OSS, Cloud, and Arena boundary

The public `nowcoding` repository contains the trust-critical local and
self-hosted code:

- CLI, parsers, daemon, diagnostics, privacy trimming, and upload client.
- Self-hosted web app, ingest API, profile page, SVG card, badges, heatmap, and
  public JSON endpoints.
- Shared schemas, cost estimation, public rendering, and self-host deployment
  docs.

The private `nowcoding-cloud` service owns the hosted network layer:

- GitHub OAuth, official accounts, username ownership, and device tokens.
- Official profile/card/badge hosting under `https://nowcoding.cc`.
- Arena leaderboards, anti-abuse, moderation/admin tools, teams, and future
  billing.

Arena is opt-in. Self-hosted deployments do not contact NowCoding Cloud or Arena
unless you explicitly run a Cloud login/connect command.

## Privacy model

NowCoding uses a fail-closed privacy model:

- Prompt and completion text are never stored.
- Project names are hidden by default.
- Hostname upload is enabled by default for multi-device dedupe and can be
  disabled locally.
- Optional fields are stored only when both local config and server settings
  allow them.
- Sessions are represented by hashes instead of raw local session identifiers.
- Ingest endpoints require `NOWCODING_API_TOKEN`.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the threat model and reporting process.

## Deployment

The self-hosted production path is Vercel plus standard Postgres. The hosted
Cloud V2 path uses Supabase for Auth, Postgres, Edge Functions, and scheduled
aggregation behind `https://nowcoding.cc`.

1. Fork or clone this repository.
2. Create a Vercel project from the repo.
3. Provision Supabase Postgres or provide another standard `DATABASE_URL`.
4. Set `NOWCODING_USERNAME`, `NOWCODING_API_TOKEN`, and `CRON_SECRET`.
5. Run `pnpm db:push`.
6. Configure the local CLI with `nowcoding init`.
7. Run `nowcoding sync` or start the daemon.

Detailed instructions are in [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md) and
[docs/env.md](docs/env.md).

## Known limits

- Cursor and Windsurf parsing are disabled until their local storage formats are
  safe enough to support.
- GitHub README images are not truly realtime because GitHub controls its image
  cache.
- The current product is single-tenant by default.
- Hostname is stored for dedupe and future multi-device analytics, but the
  profile UI does not yet expose a device leaderboard.
